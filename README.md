# Hello-folks

Hi people! Prashanth Gopalabhatla aka Codeprime-21 here, getting started with github journey. This environment seems a little messy to me with newly introtuced "cachy" names to me.
But, i hope i'll learn about this fast and fall in love with Github.
I created this account almost a year ago(2020), but getting started on 08-06-2021. (Remember this date @github ðŸ˜‰)
I am a CS undergraduate (currently fresher going to be a sophomore in a month) at VIT-AP University, from Hyderabad, Telangana, India.
Nothing more to say about this and yes...am very curious to solve real-world problems with coding!
